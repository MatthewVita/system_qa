# Contributing

Hopefully this dev guide provided the needed dev information for you to start contributing. The playbook yaml format may be a tad intimidating at first, but itâ€™s actually really easy to follow once you start hacking away and following at the existing playbooks.

Please add your operating system (or improve an existing one) by building up playbooks based on the existing patterns. If anything is not clear, please leave a PR and your questions will be addressed! Submitting a somewhat-working PR is seen as the start of a conversation and is encouraged!

**The MOST important tasks can be found on the README under "Project TODOs". _Please_ consider picking a task from that if you aren't adding an OS! THANK YOU.**
